# Research Report: Supporting a CV Maker Website with ATS Checker and AI Chatbot

## Introduction
In today’s competitive job market, creating an effective CV is critical for job seekers to stand out and pass initial screening processes, particularly those involving Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). The proposed CV maker website addresses this need by offering three key features: a normal building interface for manual data input, an ATS checker to ensure compatibility with recruitment systems, and an AI chatbot to streamline CV creation. This report compiles research to demonstrate the importance and viability of this idea, highlighting the prevalence of ATS, the benefits of AI in CV creation, and market demand for such tools.

## Research Findings

### 1. Prevalence and Importance of ATS
**Overview**: Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are software tools used by employers to manage job applications, filtering resumes based on keywords, formatting, and other criteria. Their widespread adoption makes ATS optimization essential for job seekers.

**Key Statistics**:
- **Fortune 500 Adoption**: 97.4% of Fortune 500 companies used ATS in 2023, increasing to 98.4% in 2024 (Jobscan, 2023, 2024).
- **Small Business Usage**: 36% of companies with fewer than 100 employees and 89% of those with over 500 employees use ATS or HRIS (Criteria Corp, 2023).
- **Growth Trend**: ATS usage is expanding among small businesses due to time and cost savings (iCIMS, 2023).

**Implications**: The high adoption rate across company sizes underscores the need for an ATS checker to help users format CVs correctly (e.g., using standard fonts like Arial or Calibri) and include relevant keywords to avoid being filtered out.

### 2. Challenges and Statistics Around ATS Filtering
**Overview**: ATS can significantly impact job applications by filtering out resumes that don’t meet specific criteria, making optimization crucial.

**Key Statistics**:
- **Rejection Rates**: Up to 75% of qualified candidates may be filtered out by ATS due to keyword mismatches or formatting issues, though this figure is debated (Oorwin, 2023).
- **Screening Impact**: 80% of resumes fail to pass initial screens, often due to ATS filtering (ResumeWorded, 2023).
- **Application Volume**: The average job posting receives 250 applications, with recruiters spending only 6-8 seconds per resume (Zippia, 2023; Teal HQ, 2023).

**Debate on Rejection Rates**: Some sources argue the 75% rejection rate lacks credible backing, originating from a defunct company, Preptel (HiringThing, 2023; Assaf, 2023). However, Jobscan notes that unoptimized CVs may not appear in recruiter searches, effectively reducing visibility.

**Implications**: An ATS checker can address these challenges by ensuring CVs meet ATS criteria, such as proper formatting and keyword inclusion, increasing the likelihood of human review.

### 3. Benefits of AI in CV Creation
**Overview**: AI-powered tools streamline CV creation, offering efficiency, keyword optimization, and tailored content suggestions.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Time Efficiency**: AI generates CVs quickly from profiles or templates, reducing manual effort (Kahn Litwin Renza, 2023).
- **Keyword Optimization**: AI tailors CVs to job descriptions, increasing ATS compatibility (Michael Page, 2023).
- **Error Reduction**: AI identifies grammatical and formatting issues (LiveCareer, 2023).
- **Content Suggestions**: AI provides tailored phrases for skills and achievements, enhancing CV quality (LiveCareer, 2023).

**Challenges**:
- **Lack of Personalization**: AI-generated CVs may feel generic or keyword-stuffed (Forbes, 2023).
- **Mitigation**: Encourage users to customize AI outputs and combine with manual input.

**Implications**: An AI chatbot can guide users through CV creation, offering real-time suggestions and ensuring ATS compatibility, making the process accessible to all skill levels.
